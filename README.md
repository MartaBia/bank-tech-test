# Bank tech test

## Specification

This is a simple bank program, created with Ruby, that allows the users to do deposits and withdrawals.
It also allow the users to see their account statments (Transaction date, transaction amount and total balance) with transactions in reverse chronological order.

It is possible to interact with the probram via Ruby's shell, IRB.

## How to run the program

Before running this program make sure you have Ruby installed on your machine by typing in your terminal:

`ruby -v`

Otherwise you can install it by following the instructions reported [on the Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

Once you have done it, you can interact with the program via IRB by simply typing on the terminal:

`irb`

Here is an example on how you can do it from the root directory of the project:

## My approach to the problem

I started approaching my problem creating some user stories and highlighting the relevant nouns and verbs.

I then created a diagram with the classes and their method.

## Work in progress

As I first designed my app, I included an extra interface class to allow the program to be run from the command line.
Unfortunately, as the time was running out and the deadline was approaching the class wasn't working as I would have liked to and therefore I decided to remove it to continue to work on that as soon as I'll have the chance.
