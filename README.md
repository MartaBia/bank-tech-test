# Bank tech test

## Specification

This is a simple bank program, created with Ruby, that allows the users to do deposits and withdrawals.
It also allow the users to see their account statments (Transaction date, transaction amount and total balance) with transactions in reverse chronological order.

It is possible to interact with the probram via Ruby's shell, IRB.

## How to run the program

To run this program install Ruby first:

You can run the test with:

## My approach to the problem

I started approaching my problem creating some user stories and highlighting the relevant nouns and verbs.

I then created a diagram with the classes and their method.

## Work in progress

As I first design my app, I included an extra interface class to allow the program to be run from the command line.
Unfortunately, as the time was running out and the deadline was approaching the class wasn't working as I would have liked to and therefore I decided to remove it to continue to work on that as soon as I'll have the chance.
